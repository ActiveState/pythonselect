pythonselect
============

pythonselect is a tool to set the current Python version; it is included with
`ActivePython`_. If you have multiple Python versions installed - say, 2.6, 2.7
and 3.1 - then running the following will set Python 2.7 to be your current
Python:

::

    $ sudo pysel 2.7
    or
    C:\> pysel 2.7

On **OSX**, pythonselect does this by creating appropriate symlinks in
``/usr/local/bin`` (hence ``sudo`` is required) targetting the necessary
binaries in your non-system framework Python install at
``/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework``.

On **Windows**, pythonselect does this by manipulating the system ``%PATH%``
environment variable, `AppPath`_ and .py/.pyw associations. You will have to
launch a new Command Prompt. Windows support is **experimental**. Note that on
Vista and Windows 7, ``pysel`` must be run from an Administrator Command Window.


Credits

pythonselect is based on Komodo_'s internal `set-curr-python.py`_.


Roadmap

Linux support is on the horizon.
